It looks like the best approach is to use shared datasources, shared datasets and embedded datasets in reports which use shared datasets. Shared datasets should use stored procedures to receive data so you will be able to cover your SQL logic by unit tests.\n\nSo you will have the next types of files in your project:\n\n*.rdl - reports\n*.rsd - shared datasets\n*.rds - shared datasources\n\nTo deploy them to clean SSRS server we can use RS tool. And that is a bat file to call it:\nREM SSRS server, you can provide also user and password to RS tool if you can't use Windows credentials (default behaviour)\nset varServerPath=http://desktop-h33a7aa/reportserver\nREM name of folder at SSRS server for reports\nset varReportFolder=My_Reports\nREM name of folder at SSRS server for datasets\nSet varDatasetFolder=Datasets\nREM name of folder at SSRS server for data sources\nset varDataSourceFolder=Data Sources\nREM path to a folder with reports, datasets and datasources\nset varReportFilePath=.\\Project\\Reports\\My_Reports\n\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services\\Shared Tools\\rs.exe\" -i Commonscript.rss -s %varServerPath% -v ReportFolder=\"%varReportFolder%\" -v DataSetFolder=\"%varDatasetFolder%\" -v DataSourceFolder=\"%varDataSourceFolder%\" -v filePath=\"%varReportFilePath%\" -e Mgmt2010\n\nAll logic is described in Commonscript.rss. It creates folders in SSRS server for reports, datasets and datasources (using CreateFolders method), later it reads all *.rds files in varReportFilePath and create datasources for each file if it doesn't exist. After it reads all *.rsd files in varReportFilePath, create datasets and connects a dataset with a datasource. In the end it read all *.rdl files in varReportFilePath, create reports and connects a report with a dataset.\nDim definition As [Byte]() = Nothing\nDim bytedefinition as [Byte]() = nothing\nDim warnings As Warning() = Nothing\n\n'Main Entry point of utility\nPublic Sub Main()\n    Console.WriteLine()\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Initiating Deployment\")\n    rs.Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials\n    Try\n        'Create the shared data source\n        CreateFolders(DataSourceFolder,\"/\",\"Data Sources\",\"Visible\")\n        'Create the folder that will contain the shared data sets\n        CreateFolders(DataSetFolder, \"/\", \"Data Set Folder\", \"Visible\")\n        'Create the folder that will contain the deployed reports\n        CreateFolders(ReportFolder, \"/\", \"Report Folder\",\"Visible\")\n    Catch goof As Exception\n        Console.WriteLine(goof.Message)\n    End Try\n    ReadFiles(filepath, \"*.rds\")\n    ReadFiles(filepath, \"*.rsd\")\n    ReadFiles(filepath, \"*.rdl\")\nEnd Sub\n \n'Utility for creation of folders\nPublic Sub CreateFolders(ByVal folderName as string, ByVal parentPath as string, ByVal description as String, ByVal visible as string)\n    Console.WriteLine()\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Checking for Target Folders\")\n    'CatalogItem properties\n    Dim descriptionProp as new [Property]\n    descriptionProp.Name = \"Description\"\n    descriptionProp.Value= description\n    Dim visibleProp as new [Property]\n    visibleProp.Name = \"Visible\"\n    visibleProp.value= visible\n    Dim props(1) as [Property]\n    props(0) = descriptionProp\n    props(1) = visibleProp\n    Try\n        rs.CreateFolder(folderName,parentPath,props)\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Folder {0} successfully created\", foldername)\n    Catch goof as SoapException\n        If goof.Message.Indexof(\"AlreadyExists\")&gt;0 Then\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Folder {0} already exists\",foldername)\n        End If\n    End Try\nEnd Sub\n \n'Utility for reading files from the Report Sevices Project\nPublic sub ReadFiles(filepath as string, fileextension as string)\n    Console.WriteLine()\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Reading Files from Report Services Project\")\n    Dim rptdirinfo As System.IO.DirectoryInfo\n    rptdirinfo = New System.IO.DirectoryInfo(filepath)\n    Dim filedoc As FileInfo()\n    filedoc = rptdirinfo.GetFiles(fileextension)\n    Try\n        For rptcount As Integer = 0 To filedoc.Length-1\n            If Not filedoc(rptcount).Name.ToString.Trim.ToUpper.Contains(\"BACKUP\") Then\n                SELECT Case fileextension\n                Case \"*.rds\"\n                    CreateDataSource(filedoc(rptcount).tostring.trim)\n                Case \"*.rsd\"\n                    CreateDataSet(filedoc(rptcount).tostring.trim)\n                Case \"*.rdl\"\n                    PublishReport(filedoc(rptcount).tostring.trim)\n                End Select\n            End If\n        Next\n    Catch goof as Exception\n        Console.WriteLine(\"In ReadFiles \" + goof.message)\n    End Try\nEnd Sub\n \n'Utility for Creating Shared Data Sets contained in the project\nPublic Sub CreateDataSet(ByVal filename as string)\n    Dim valstart as integer\n    Dim valend as integer\n    Dim DSDefinitionStr as string\n    Dim DataSourceName as string\n    Dim QueryString as string\n    Try\n        Dim stream As FileStream = File.OpenRead(filePath + \"\\\" + filename )\n        definition = New [Byte](stream.Length-1) {}\n        stream.Read(definition, 0, CInt(stream.Length))\n        stream.Close()\n        For i As Integer = 0 To definition.Length -

'/5' is optional and it works the same as previous one, so '10-20/5' for minutes means run at 10, 15 and 20;\n'5' - one value only, e.g. only at 5th minute\n'5,10,15,45' - list value, e.g. run at 5th, 10th, 15th and 45th minutes\n\nopen System\nopen System.Text.RegularExpressions\n\nmodule Schedule =\n    // regexp for */5\n    [&lt;Literal&gt;]\n    let DividePattern = @\"(\\*/\\d+)\"\n    // regexp for range\n    [&lt;Literal&gt;]\n    let RangePattern = @\"(\\d+\\-\\d+(/\\d+)?)\"\n    // regexp for wild char\n    [&lt;Literal&gt;]\n    let WildPattern = @\"(\\*)\"\n    // regexp for one value\n    [&lt;Literal&gt;]\n    let OneValuePattern = @\"(\\d)\"\n    // regexp for list value\n    [&lt;Literal&gt;]\n    let ListPattern = @\"((\\d+,)+\\d+)\"\n\n    // internal record to parsed cron expression, so it contains minutes,\n    // hours, days of month, months and day of week when we should run our jobs\n    type ISchedueSet = \n        { \n            Minutes: int list;\n            Hours: int list;\n            DayOfMonth: int list;\n            Months: int list;\n            DayOfWeek: int list\n        }\n    \n    // method to generate ISchedueSet record from cron expression\n    let generate expression =\n        // internal method to parse */5 \n        let dividedArray (m:string) start max =\n            let divisor = m |&gt;  String.split [|'/'|] |&gt; Array.skip 1 |&gt; Array.head |&gt; Int32.Parse\n            [start .. max] |&gt; List.filter (fun x -&gt; x % divisor = 0)\n        // internal method to parse range\n        let rangeArray (m:string) =\n            let split = m |&gt; String.split [|'-'; '/'|] |&gt; Array.map Int32.Parse\n            match Array.length split with\n                | 2 -&gt; [split.[0] .. split.[1]]\n                | 3 -&gt; [split.[0] .. split.[1]] |&gt; List.filter (fun x -&gt; x % split.[2] = 0)\n                | _ -&gt; []\n        // internal method to parse wild char\n        let wildArray (m:string) start max =\n            [start .. max]\n        // internal method to parse single value\n        let oneValue (m:string) =\n            [m |&gt; Int32.Parse]\n        // internal method to parse list value\n        let listArray (m:string) =\n            m |&gt; String.split [|','|] |&gt; Array.map Int32.Parse |&gt; Array.toList\n        \n        // we need to set minimum and maximum value for every part of date time\n        let getStartAndMax i =\n            match i with\n            // for minutes\n            | 0 -&gt; (0, 59)\n            // for hours\n            | 1 -&gt; (0, 23)\n            // for days of month\n            | 2 -&gt; (1, 31)\n            // for months\n            | 3 -&gt; (1, 12)\n            // for day of week\n            | 4 -&gt; (0, 6)\n            // throw an exception if don't know for what part of date time we need values\n            | _ -&gt; raise (TooMuchArgumentsException i)\n        \n        // active pattern to match regexp\n        let (|MatchRegex|_|) pattern input =\n            let m = Regex.Match(input, pattern)\n            if m.Success then Some (m.ToString()) else None\n        \n        // parsing cron expression and create a array of lists which contains all possibles values\n        // for every part of daytime\n        let parts =\n            expression \n            |&gt; String.split [|' '|]\n            |&gt; Array.mapi (fun i x -&gt;\n                let (start, max) = getStartAndMax i \n                match x with\n                    | MatchRegex DividePattern x -&gt; dividedArray x start max\n                    | MatchRegex RangePattern x -&gt; rangeArray x\n                    | MatchRegex WildPattern x -&gt; wildArray x start max\n                    | MatchRegex ListPattern x -&gt; listArray x\n                    | MatchRegex OneValuePattern x -&gt; oneValue x\n                    | _ -&gt; []\n            )\n        // convert list of array to ISchedueSet\n        { \n            Minutes = parts.[0];\n            Hours = parts.[1];\n            DayOfMonth = parts.[2];\n            Months = parts.[3];\n            DayOfWeek = parts.[4]\n        }\n    // method to check date time via generated ISchedueSet\n    let isTime schedueSet (dateTime : DateTime) =\n        List.exists ((=) dateTime.Minute) schedueSet.Minutes &amp;&amp; \n        List.exists ((=) dateTime.Hour) schedueSet.Hours &amp;&amp;\n        List.exists ((=) dateTime.Day) schedueSet.DayOfMonth &amp;&amp;\n        List.exists ((=) dateTime.Month) schedueSet.Months &amp;&amp;\n        List.exists ((=) (int dateTime.DayOfWeek)) schedueSet.DayOfWeek\n\nSo Schedule module contains two methods and one type: \n\nISchedueSet is a container for parsed cron expression;\ngenerate is to generate ISchedueSet record from cron expression.

Luckly there is two nice tools/libs to do it: tSQLt and SQLCover.\n\nIn this article I will show how to create/set up SQLCover and run it for each CI build.\nThe basic idea is we are creating command line application which runs our tSQLt unit tests via SQLCover and generates HTML report with code coverage information.\nUnfortunately there is no SQLCover package in NuGet, but we can download it from here.\nCreate a new command line application, add references to SQLCover.dll and Microsoft.SqlServer.TransactSql.ScriptDom.dll.\nAfter that there is an example of Program.cs:\n    private const string RunAllSqlTestsCommand = \"exec tSQLt.RunAll;\";\n    private const string DefaultDatabaseName = \"MyDB\";\n\n    private const string ReportName = \"SQLCoverage.html\";\n\n    static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        var connectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[DefaultDatabaseName].ConnectionString;\n        var coverage = new CodeCoverage(connectionString, DefaultDatabaseName);\n        var result = coverage.Cover(RunAllSqlTestsCommand);\n        var updatedResult =  result.Html();\n        File.WriteAllText(ReportName, updatedResult);\n    }\n\nAfter execution you will see SQLCoverage.html with code coverage statistics in the same folder.\nOne note from SQLCover owner: \"When we target local sql instances we delete the trace files but when targetting remote instances we are unable to delete the files as we do not (or potentially) do not have access. If this is the case keep an eye on the log directory and remove old \"SQLCover-Trace-.xel\" and \"SQLCover-Trace-.xem\" files.\"\nThanks.\n","id":"https://eapyl.github.io/how-to-sql-code-coverage/","title":"How to set up SQL code coverage"},"https://eapyl.github.io/iis-7-httpmodule-logger/":{"body":"Простой модуль-лог для IIS 7 (Classic mode)\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Web;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Threading;\nusing System.Net;\nusing ReutersKnowledge.Web.Services.Util;\nusing System.Collections.Specialized;\nusing System.Reflection;\n \nnamespace IISWsgLogger\n{\n    public class IISLoggerModule : IHttpModule\n    {\n        private static string fileName = \"D:\\\\Log.txt\";\n \n        private static ConcurrentQueue&lt;string&gt;

I just want to listen radio and that is all! Quite simple, hah?\n\nSo I decided to create a simple radio mobile application by myself. I thought about Xamarin as I have some experience in creating application using it. But I decided to use new framework for me and it is Ionic. I am very impressed how cool it is and how easy to create application using it. It took about 2 hours to install all dependencies (ionic, android studio, java), deploy and run a first version of my application on my android device. Quite fast!\nI am using Ubuntu 16.04.\nPlease find the steps below:\n\nI have installed ionic framework using this link and create blank application: ionic start radioOn blank.\nAnd that is all, to start our application need to run ionic serve.\nAs I want to listen an online radio, I need to create a provider to listen online stream: Html5Audio:\n\nimport { Injectable, Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class Html5Audio {\n    @Output()\n    ended = new EventEmitter();\n\n    private pad2(number) { (number &lt; 10 ?

Click on a station - starting this station, and there is one button to stop music(link). That is all. Simple!\nAfter that we need to prepare icon and splash image for application. I am using game-icons to create an icon and unspalsh to find full size images.\nNeed to put created icon.png and splash.png to /resources/icon.png and /resources/splash.png and run the next command ionic cordova resources (you have to have an account in Ionic portal and it is free).\nTo deploy our application need to run ionic cordova build android --prod --release and it will create *.apk file. We need to sign it using 'Sign Android APK' section from here.\nThat is all. We have signed apk which we can copy on our device and install.\n\nPlease find my project here.

Previously we used just serilog to do our logging in all our containers. So each project had his own logging mechanism. Finally we decided to centralize our logging system ans start using docker logs. There are a lot of solutions using clouds (e.g. loggly) or quite complex systems to grab, analyze and show your logs (like kafka, kibana). But we wanted to save our logs to simple txt files without any additional complex stuff.\n\nThere are nice project which allows automatically read docker container logs and push them to one syslog server - logspout.\nWe tried to find simple syslog server without success. So there is a small syslog server written in dotnet core. I used serilog to write logs to files (Rolling File).\nSo docker-compose configuration looks like:\n  #another containers\n  logspout:\n    image: gliderlabs/logspout\n    command: syslog+tcp://logcollector:5000\n    volumes:\n      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\n    depends_on:\n      - logcollector\n  logcollector:\n    image: eapyl/syslog-collector\n    volumes: \n      - $PWD/../logs:/log/logs\n\nAfter that logs from all our containers are in logs folder!

Следует отметить, что tcp-пакеты могут приходить на машину назначение беспорядочно. Таким образом класс Sniffer, используя библиотеку WinPcap упорядочивает все пакеты.\n\nПроект на VS2008 SharkTrace.\nВажно! Библиотека SharpPcap уже давно имеет новый интерфейс.\nДалее в тексте, под соединением я понимаю соответствие адресов и портов на клиенте и сервере. \nДля работы необходима открытая библиотека SharpPcap, она предоставляет удобный интерфейс для работы с приложением WinPcap (Sharppcap).\nКласс соединения используется для хранения информации об адресе клиента и сервера, о портах, а так же об текущем ожидаемом tcp-пакете.\nБольше о флагах tcp-пакета можно посмотреть http://www.firewall.cx. \n///&lt;summary&gt;\n///class for connection\n///&lt;/summary&gt;\ninternal class Connection\n{\n    public long ClientAddress; // client initiating the connection\n    public int ClientPort;\n    public long HostAddress; // host receiving the connection\n    public int HostPort;\n    public long ClientSyn; // starting syn sent from client\n    public long HostSyn; // starting syn sent from host;\n    public long NextClientSeq; // this must be in SequenceNumber field of TCP packet if it is from client\n    public long NextHostSeq; // this must be in SequenceNumber field of TCP packet if it is from host\n    public bool HostClosed;\n    public bool ClientClosed;\n    public long TimeIdentifier;\n    public bool ThreeWayCompleted = false; // three way connection is completed\n \n    // Fragments , used when we get newer packets that expected.\n    // so we need to wait for expected before adding them.\n    public SortedDictionary&lt;long, TcpPacket&gt; HostFragments = new SortedDictionary&lt;long, TcpPacket&gt;();\n    public SortedDictionary&lt;long, TcpPacket&gt; ClientFragments = new SortedDictionary&lt;long, TcpPacket&gt;();\n \n    // returns client ip:client port as a string\n    public string GetClientAddressPort()\n    {\n        return string.Format(\"{0}:{1}\", new IPAddress(ClientAddress).ToString(), ClientPort);\n    }\n \n    // returns host ip:host port as a string\n    public string GetHostAddressPort()\n    {\n        return string.Format(\"{0}:{1}\", new IPAddress(HostAddress).ToString(), HostPort);\n    }\n \n    // packet is from host\n    public bool IsFromHost(TcpPacket tcp)\n    {\n        return ClientAddress == ((IpPacket)tcp.ParentPacket).DestinationAddress.Address &amp;&amp;\n        ClientPort == tcp.DestinationPort &amp;&amp;\n        HostAddress == ((IpPacket)tcp.ParentPacket).SourceAddress.Address &amp;&amp;\n        HostPort == tcp.SourcePort;\n    }\n \n    // packet is from client\n    public bool IsFromClient(TcpPacket tcp)\n    {\n        return ClientAddress == ((IpPacket)tcp.ParentPacket).SourceAddress.Address &amp;&amp;\n        ClientPort == tcp.SourcePort &amp;&amp;\n        HostAddress == ((IpPacket)tcp.ParentPacket).DestinationAddress.Address &amp;&amp;\n        HostPort == tcp.DestinationPort;\n    }\n \n    public Connection(long clientAddress, int clientPort, long hostAddress, int hostPort, long clientSyn)\n    {\n        this.ClientAddress = clientAddress;\n        this.ClientPort = clientPort;\n        this.HostAddress = hostAddress;\n        this.HostPort = hostPort;\n        this.ClientSyn = clientSyn;\n    }\n}\n\nИтак данный класс хранит информацию о соединении. В сниффере я пропускаю процесс установления соединения (так называемое тройное рукопожатие) так как возможно мы запустим сниффер когда уже соединения было установлено (о нем можно почитать wikipedia.org). Поэтому происходит попытка создания соединения, если оно еще не было создано. Ловятся пакеты, которые имеют \"полезную\" информацию в себе (payload data).\nБольше о TCP пакетах wikipedia.org.\nМетоды RunSniffer и StopSniffer - запускают и останавливают сниффер соответственно. Метод AssemblePacket на вход получает tcp-пакет, и проверяет существует ли соединение, которому \"принадлежит\" этот пакет. Если нет - создается, если да - то работает логика по упорядочиванию пакетов. Два абстрактных метода позволяют получить доступ к \"полезным\" данным последовательно (AddHostData и AddClientData) \n/// &lt;summary&gt;\n/// Main class for sniffering\n/// &lt;/summary&gt;\n/// &lt;remarks&gt;\n/// 1.

This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.\n\n\nLightweight\n\nContainers running on a single machine share the same operating system kernel; they start instantly and use less RAM. Images are constructed from layered filesystems and share common files, making disk usage and image downloads much more efficient.\n\nOpen and supported by community\n\nDocker containers are based on open standards, enabling containers to run on all major Linux distributions and on Microsoft Windows - and on top of any infrastructure. In addition, because Docker's partnering with the other container powers, including Canonical, Google, Red Hat, and Parallels, on its key open-source component runc, it's brought standardization to containers. More info is here.\n\nSecure by default\n\nContainers isolate applications from one another and the underlying infrastructure, while providing an added layer of protection for the application.\nContainers and virtual machines\nContainers and virtual machines have similar resource isolation and allocation benefits - but a different architectural approach allows containers to be more portable and efficient. Docker is built on top of LXC. Like with any container technology, as far as the program is concerned, it has its own file system, storage, CPU, RAM, and so on. The key difference between containers and VMs is that while the hypervisor abstracts an entire device, containers just abstract the operating system kernel. It means that you are able to run only containers which are supported by host operating system, i.e. there are containers for Windows OS and containers for Linux.\n\nVirtual Machines\n\n\nVirtual machines include the application, the necessary binaries and libraries, and an entire guest operating system - all of which can amount to tens of GBs.\n\nContainers\n\n\nContainers include the application and all of its dependencies - but share the kernel with other containers, running as isolated processes in user space on the host operating system. Docker containers are not tied to any specific infrastructure: they run on any computer, on any infrastructure, and in any cloud.\nAdditional benefits\nDocker allows you to dynamically change your application - from adding new capabilities and scaling services, to quickly changing problem areas.\n\nShorter delivery time\n\nOn average, Docker users ship 7X more software after deploying Docker in their environment. More frequent software updates provide added value to customers.\n\nQuickly scale\n\nDocker containers spin up and down in seconds, making it easy to scale application services to satisfy peak customer demand, and then reduce running containers when demand ebbs. And Docker containers are easy to deploy in a cloud.\n\nEasily remediate issue\n\nDocker makes it easy to identify issues, isolate the problem container, quickly roll back to make the necessary changes, and then push the updated container into production. Isolation between containers makes these changes less disruptive than in traditional software models.\nIn summary: docker allows to deploy, use and support containers on production easier and safer than previous approaches. On the other hand, developers can use Docker to pack, ship, and run any application as a lightweight, portable, self sufficient LXC container that can run virtually anywhere.\nDocker toolset\nDocker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers:\n\nEncapsulate your applications (and supporting components) into Docker containers\nDistribute and ship those containers to your teams for further development and testing\nDeploy those applications to your production environment, whether it is in a local data center or the Cloud\n\nDocker Engine\nDocker Engine is a client-server application with these major components:\n\nA server which is a type of long-running program called a daemon process.\nA REST API which specifies interfaces that programs can use to talk to the daemon and instruct it what to do.\nA command line interface (CLI) client.\n\n\nWhat can I use Docker for?\nDocker can streamline the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. You can also integrate Docker into your continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflow.\nDocker’s portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically manage workloads, scaling up or tearing down applications and services as business needs dictate, in near real time.\nDocker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative to hypervisor-based virtual machines, allowing you to use more of your compute capacity to achieve your business goals.\nDocker’s architecture\nDocker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. One client can even communicate with multiple unrelated daemons.\n\nInside Docker\n\nDocker images\n\nA Docker image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. For example, an image might contain an Nano Server operating system with dotnet core and your web application installed. You can build or update images from scratch or download and use images created by others. A docker image is described in text file called a Dockerfile, which has a simple, well-defined syntax.\nDocker images are the build component of Docker.\n\nDocker containers\n\nA Docker container is a runnable instance of a Docker image. You can run, start, stop, move, or delete a container using Docker API or CLI commands. When you run a container, you can provide configuration metadata such as networking information or environment variables. Each container is an isolated and secure application platform, but can be given access to resources running in a different host or container, as well as persistent storage or databases.\nDocker containers are the run component of Docker.\n\nDocker registries\n\nA docker registry is a library of images. A registry can be public or private, and can be on the same server as the Docker daemon or Docker client, or on a totally separate server.\nDocker registries are the distribution component of Docker.\n\nDocker services\n\nA Docker service allows a swarm of Docker nodes to work together, running a defined number of instances of a replica task, which is itself a Docker image. You can specify the number of concurrent replica tasks to run, and the swarm manager ensures that the load is spread evenly across the worker nodes. To the consumer, the Docker service appears to be a single application.\nDocker services are the scalability component of Docker.\nDocker image work\nDocker images are read-only templates from which Docker containers are instantiated. Each image consists of a series of layers. Docker uses union file systems to combine these layers into a single image. Union file systems allow files and directories of separate file systems, known as branches, to be transparently overlaid, forming a single coherent file system.\nThese layers are one of the reasons Docker is so lightweight. When you change a Docker image, such as when you update an application to a new version, a new layer is built and replaces only the layer it updates. The other layers remain intact. To distribute the update, you only need to transfer the updated layer. Layering speeds up distribution of Docker images. Docker determines which layers need to be updated at runtime.\nAn image is defined in a Dockerfile. Every image starts from a base image, such as ubuntu (Note: Docker Hub is a public registry and stores images). The base image is defined using the FROM keyword in the dockerfile. There are a set of intructions after this world usually. Each instruction creates a new layer in the image:\n\nSpecify the base image (FROM)\nSpecify the maintainer (LABEL)\nRun a command (RUN)\nAdd a file or directory (ADD)\nCreate an environment variable (ENV)\nWhat process to run when launching a container from this image (CMD)\n\nDocker reads this Dockerfile when you request a build of an image, executes the instructions, and returns the image.\nDocker registry work\nA Docker registry stores Docker images. After you build a Docker image, you can push it to a public registry such as Docker Hub or to a private registry running behind your firewall. You can also search for existing images and pull them from the registry to a host.\nContainer work\nA container uses the host machine’s Linux/Windows kernel, and consists of any extra files you add when the image is created, along with metadata associated with the container at creation or when the container is started. Each container is built from an image. The image defines the container’s contents, which process to run when the container is launched, and a variety of other configuration details. The Docker image is read-only. When Docker runs a container from an image, it adds a read-write layer on top of the image in which your application runs.\nWhat happens when you run a container?\nWhen you use the docker run CLI command or the equivalent API, the Docker Engine client instructs the Docker daemon to run a container. For example:\n$ docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash\n\nWhen you run this command, Docker Engine does the following:\n\nPulls the ubuntu image: Docker Engine checks for the presence of the ubuntu image. If the image already exists locally, Docker Engine uses it for the new container. Otherwise, then Docker Engine pulls it from Docker Hub.\nCreates a new container: Docker uses the image to create a container.\nAllocates a filesystem and mounts a read-write layer: The container is created in the file system and a read-write layer is added to the image.\nAllocates a network / bridge interface: Creates a network interface that allows the Docker container to talk to the local host.\nSets up an IP address: Finds and attaches an available IP address from a pool.\nExecutes a process that you specify: Executes the /bin/bash executable.\nCaptures and provides application output: Connects and logs standard input, outputs and errors for you to see how your application is running, because you requested interactive mode.\n\nYou can manage and interact with it, use the services and applications it provides, and eventually stop and remove it.\nThe underlying technology\nDocker is written in Go programming language.\nNamespaces\nDocker uses a technology called namespaces to provide the isolated workspace called the container. When you run a container, Docker creates a set of namespaces for that container.\nThese namespaces provide a layer of isolation. Each aspect of a container runs in a separate namespace and its access is limited to that namespace.\nDocker Engine uses namespaces such as the following on Linux:\n\nThe pid namespace: Process isolation (PID: Process ID).\nThe net namespace: Managing network interfaces (NET: Networking).\nThe ipc namespace: Managing access to IPC resources (IPC: InterProcess Communication).\nThe mnt namespace: Managing filesystem mount points (MNT: Mount).\nThe uts namespace: Isolating kernel and version identifiers. (UTS: Unix Timesharing System).\n\nControl groups\nDocker Engine on Linux also relies on another technology called control groups (cgroups). A cgroup limits an application to a specific set of resources. Control groups allow Docker Engine to share available hardware resources to containers and optionally enforce limits and constraints. For example, you can limit the memory available to a specific container.\nUnion file systems\nUnion file systems, or UnionFS, are file systems that operate by creating layers, making them very lightweight and fast. Docker Engine uses UnionFS to provide the building blocks for containers.\nContainer format\nDocker Engine combines the namespaces, control groups, and UnionFS into a wrapper called a container format.\nResourses:\n\nWhat is Docker?\nWhat is Docker and why is it so darn popular?\nПонимая Docker\nDocker Overview\nDocker libcontainer unifies Linux container powers\nASP.NET Community Standup - January 17th, 2017 - Messing with Docker\nWorking with Windows Containers and Docker: The Basics\nUnderstanding Docker presentation\n\n","id":"https://eapyl.github.io/understanding-docker/","title":"Understanding Docker"},"https://eapyl.github.io/update-pip-application-in-ubuntu/":{"body":"To update application installed by pip, e.g. streamlink:\nsudo pip install -U streamlink\n","id":"https://eapyl.github.io/update-pip-application-in-ubuntu/","title":"Update pip application in Ubuntu"},"https://eapyl.github.io/use-logparser/":{"body":"\nDownload LogParser 2.2.\nC:&gt;tlbimp LogParser.dll /out:Interop.MSUtil.dll\nInclude Interop.MSUtil.dll in a project.\n\n\nusing LogQuery = Interop.MSUtil.LogQueryClassClass;\nusing IISW3CInputFormat = Interop.MSUtil.COMIISW3CInputContextClassClass;\nusing CsvOutputFormat = Interop.MSUtil.COMCSVOutputContextClassClass;\nusing LogRecordSet = Interop.MSUtil.ILogRecordset;\n\nLogQuery oLogQuery = new LogQuery();\n\n// Instantiate the Event Log Input Format object\nIISW3CInputFormat oW3CInputFormat = new IISW3CInputFormat();\n\nstring query = String.Format(_queryPostOverall, _pathToLog, \"200\", _date);\nvar oRecordSet = oLogQuery.Execute(query, oW3CInputFormat);\nfor (; !oRecordSet.atEnd(); oRecordSet.moveNext())\n{\n   double count = Convert.ToDouble(oRecordSet.getRecord().getValue(\"count1\"));\n   _postCountOverall.overall += count;\n}\noRecordSet.close();\n","id":"https://eapyl.github.io/use-logparser/","title":"Use LogParser"},"https://eapyl.github.io/use-websql-and-indexeddb-in-typescript/":{"body":"More information about IndexedDb or WebSQL.\n\nLet's define base interfaces for our task:\nexport interface IItem {\n    id: string;\n    value: string;\n}\n\nexport interface IStorage&lt;T extends IItem&gt; {\n    // Initial method to create storage\n    init(name: string): Observable&lt;IStorage&lt;T&gt;&gt;;\n\n    // Get the value by unique key\n    get(key: string): Observable&lt;T&gt;;\n\n    // Clear/remove all data in the storage\n    clear(): Observable&lt;T&gt;;\n\n    // Put specific value into the storage\n    put(value: T): Observable&lt;T&gt;;\n\n    // Get all values using the set of keys\n    getDenseBatch(keys: string[]): Observable&lt;T&gt;;\n\n    // Get all values from the storage\n    all(): Observable&lt;T&gt;;\n}\n\nHere I am using rxjs to handle results.

Hope it will be useful to create an  impression what you can expect from this event.\nMy stream technology is server-side .NET or ASP.NET MVC. My current project is on .NET platform, the main technology is Windows Workflow Foundation and I am not using Xamarin platform. But I had a small experience in Xamarin that I got during working on my previous project.\n\nSome time ago I had a chance to visit Xamarin Dev Days event in Warsaw. It was one day event in Warsaw Microsoft office. There were two part: the first one is generic information about Xamarin ecosystem and Azure Mobile Apps. The second one is hands on lab. So this presentation has been created to summarize and do a short recap mentioned event.\nAgenda:\n\nIntroduction to Xamarin\nXamarin.Forms\nAzure Mobile Apps\nSample application\nResources\n\n\nThe first thing that you should keep in mind when you are talking about Xamarin is that you are able to write application not using Visual Studio on Windows only, but also Xamarin Studio on Mac. As I understand, usually people are using Visual Studio to develop Android and Phone applications and Xamarin Studio on Mac to develop IOS application. But, of course, the team is using one code base. The reason of this approach, that it is much more quicker to build IOS application on MAC directly, without remote building using Visual Studio on Windows.\nThe second thing is that Xamarin is not only about developing cross-platform applications using Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio, but Xamarin also provides possibility to test you application on various number of devices using Xamarin Cloud. As you can imagine, it is very expensive to buy all set of mobile devices for testing, so this cloud allows you to run your application on thousand of real devices in the cloud, analyze detailed test reports with results, screenshots, and performance metrics. Also it allows you to measure performance of your application. Sounds very cool, but there was a question from Xamarin Dev Days presenter about if there is someone who is using this cloud and nobody answered.\nThe third thing is about building and continuous integration. Actually it is not about Xamarin but about TFS(Team Foundation Server). You are able to install it on your private server or it is possible to use Visual Studio Online service from Microsoft. It is free for small teams. It provides opportunity to work with your code (git), use agile board to organize your work, set up your continuous integration project (pure version of team city), create test cases. I heard that they added Wiki also.\nThe last one is about distributing and monitoring. I can’t say a lot about distributing as I have never put any application to stores. As for monitoring, there is Xamarin Insight. It is the same approach as Visual Studio Application Insights. It is an extensible analytics service that helps you understand the performance and usage of your live mobile application. It's designed for developers, to help you continuously improve the performance and usability of your app. It allows:\n\nsee user sessions in real time\nsee which users are being affected by which errors\nsee stacktraces for each exception\nsee device stats for each exception (operating system, app version, network status, device orientation, jalbreak status, and bluetooth status)\nsee advanced reporting and filtering of aggregate exception statistics\nsetup webhooks for triggering actions on certain Insights events\nintegrate with third-party services (Campire, Github, HipChat, Jira, PivotalTracker, and Visual Studio Online)\n\nApproaches:\n\nSeparate solutions for each platform (Android, IOS, Windows)\n\nMany projects, many languages, many teams\n\n\nOne universal solution (JS + HTML + CSS) - Cordova\n\nSlow performance, limited native API\n\n\nXamarin approach (shared code + platform specific UI)\n\nGood performance, almost all native API\n\n\nReactNative and NativeScript\n\nOnly Android and IOS (UWP in future)\n\n\n\nHere I want to show the main ways to build mobile application.\n\n\nOf course, firstly it is native apps. It is clear. Swift, object-C for IOS, java is for Android, C# is  for Windows Phone. It means you should have and support many projects and many teams. It is a good option if you are planning to build complex and big mobile application. The best scenario is if this application has only mobile version.\nUniversal solution. You are able to use Cordova and build you application using JavaScript. Personally I really like this approach as you are able to build almost any type of application using Javascript now. To execute javascript on server - NodeJs. For desktop application there is Electron framework. Cordova is to create mobile applications. The problem here is performance. The resulting applications are hybrid, meaning that they are neither truly native mobile application (because all layout rendering is done via Web views instead of the platform's native UI framework) nor purely Web-based (because they are not just Web apps, but are packaged as apps for distribution and have access to native device APIs). [link]\nAnd Xamarin. It looks like win-win strategy if you already have web or desktop application written on .NET. You are able to share code, get native performance (almost, depends how you are creating application, Xamarin.Forms, for example, can create non the best implementation), access to all native API (almost). If there is a new version of OS, need to wait implementation in Xamarin up to one month.\nReactNative and NativeScript created and supported by Facebook and Telerik. ReactNative hasn’t final version still, but NativeScript has version 2.0. They are the most young libraries in the list. JavaScript is the language to write a code. But unlike Cordova transform Javascript elements to native UI elements. Support Android and IOS now. Microsoft is working to add UWP here (NativeScript). Looks like the most perspective platforms. You are able to use Angular2 + Typescript + NativeScript or ReactJs + ReactNative to write mobile applications and share code also with your web version of application. Probably it is the best frameworks if your application is web first.\n\nXamarin features\n\nProduce ARM binary for Apple store\nProduce APK for Android\nPossibility to use only one IDE (Visual Studio)\nAndroid Hyper-V and IOS Remote emulators\nDesigners for IOS, Android and Windows Phone in Visual Studio\nXamarin Studio for Mac\nMVVM pattern (XAML)\n\nHere I put the main interesting features of Xamarin:\n\nXamarin allows to ship native app bundles on the App Store. Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler compiles Xamarin.iOS apps directly to native ARM assembly code, meaning your app is a native platform binary.\nAs for Android, Xamarin.Android uses just-in-time compilation for sophisticated runtime optimization of your app’s performance, meaning your app is a native Android APK.\nAlso I talked that we are able to use only one IDE to develop applications in theory. \nMicrosoft Visual Studio 2015 includes an Android emulator that you can use as a target for debugging your Xamarin.Android app: Visual Studio Emulator for Android. This emulator uses the Hyper-V capabilities of your development computer, resulting in faster launch and execution times than the default emulator that comes with the Android SDK. Also it is possible to debug IOS in Windows using remote simulator.\nVisual Studio supports also visual designers to build UI. It works almost the same like it works for WPF.\nAlso there is Visual Studio for Mac.\nThe Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern was invented with XAML in mind. The pattern enforces a separation of the XAML user interface (the View) from the underlying data (the Model) through a class that serves as an intermediary between the View and the Model (the ViewModel). The View and the ViewModel are often connected through data bindings defined in the XAML file. The BindingContext for the View is usually an instance of the ViewModel. link\n\nSharing code\n\nPortable class library\nShared projects\nUpcoming .NET Standard 2.0\n\nCurrently there are two ways to write shared code in Xamarin:\n\nShared project. Unlike most other project types, a Shared Project has no 'output' assembly. During compilation, the files are treated as part of the referencing project and compiled into that DLL. If you wish to share your code as a DLL then Portable Class Libraries are a better solution. Shared code can be branched based on the platform using compiler directives (eg. using #if _ANDROID_ , as discussed in the Building Cross Platform Applications document).\nPortable library. Only a subset of the .NET framework is available to use, determined by the profile selected (see the Introduction to PCL for more info).\nUpcoming .net standard 2.0 will support Xamarin. Basically Microsoft introduced a new .NET Standard Library. The .NET Standard Library is a formal specification of .NET APIs that are intended to be available on all .NET runtimes. The motivation behind the Standard Library is establishing greater uniformity in the .NET ecosystem.\n\nXamarin plugins (nuget)\n\nBattery\nConnectivity\nGeolocation\nMedia\nSettings\nText to speech\n...\n\nAnother one nice feature of Xamarin is Xamarin plugins that can be downloaded using nuget. These libraries allow you to use functionality that adds cross-platform functionality or abstracts platform specific functionality to a common API, like battery, geolocation, media and so on.\nYou are able to find the whole list of plugins here.\nXamarin.Forms\n\nShared UI \nPages, layouts, controls\nTwo-ways data binding\nNavigation\nAnimation\nDependency service, messaging center\nXamarin.Forms 2.0 - Performance\nThemes\nData pages\nNative embedding\n\nUse the Xamarin.Forms API provides a way to quickly build native apps for iOS, Android and Windows completely in C#. Xamarin.Forms is included with Visual Studio.\n\nXamarin allows sharing not only code between platforms, but also UI. During compilation created abstract XAML is transformed to platform specific. For example, there is the next XAML element: Entry, what is TextBox in Windows Phone. So we have an platform-specific equivalent for every control from Xamarin.Form.\nThere are three main groups in Xamarin.Form:\n\nA Xamarin.Forms.Page represents a View Controller in iOS or a Page in Windows Phone. On Android each page takes up the screen like an Activity, but Xamarin.Forms Pages are not Activities.\nThe Layout class in Xamarin.Forms is a specialized subtype of View, which acts as a container for other Layouts or Views. It typically contains logic to set the position and size of child elements in Xamarin.Forms applications.\nXamarin.Forms uses the word View to refer to visual objects such as buttons, labels or text entry boxes - which may be more commonly known as controls of widgets.\n\n\nData binding connects two objects, called the source and the target. The source object provides the data. The target object, which must be a bindable property, will consume (and often display) data from the source object.\nXamarin.Forms provides a number of different page navigation experiences, depending upon the Page type being used: Tabbed Page, Hierarchical Navigation, CarouselPage and so on.\nXamarin.Forms includes its own animation infrastructure that allows for easy creation of simple animations, while also being versatile enough to create complex animations. The Xamarin.Forms animation classes target different properties of visual elements, with a typical animation progressively changing a property from one value to another over a period of time.\nXamarin.Forms allows developers to define behavior in platform-specific projects. DependencyService then finds the right platform implementation, allowing shared code to access the native functionality.\nXamarin.Forms MessagingCenter enables view models and other components to communicate with without having to know anything about each other besides a simple Message contract.\nNative Embedding. Platform-specific controls can be directly added to a Xamarin.Forms layout. It is possible to add platform-specific controls to a Xamarin.Forms layout, and how to override the layout of custom controls in order to correct their measurement API usage.\n\nAzure Mobile Apps\n\n\nStable backend\nOffline sync\nData storage (tables, sql)\nAuthentication (Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter)\nPush notifications\n\nAzure App Service is a fully managed Platform as a Service (PaaS) that brings a rich set of capabilities to web, mobile and integration scenarios.\n\nBuild offline-ready apps with data sync.\nPush Notifications allows you to engage your clients with instant push notifications on any device.\nAuthorization using different approaches\nSave data.\n\nTake a look\n\nApp Service Helpers\nContoso Moments\n\nWant to mention two nice libraries/ applications:\n\nApp Service Helpers (ASH) makes it as easy as possible to add data storage and authentication to your mobile app with Microsoft's Azure App Service Platform. ASH was built with the mobile developer in mind, and requires no previous experience with backends as a service (BaaS). This lib was developed as a supplemental library to Microsoft's Azure Client SDK. Rather than replacing this library, ASH extends it by lowering the barrier to entry for developers who wish to build cloud-connected mobile apps in C#.\nIt is a good example how to use Azure Mobile services. Contoso Moments is a photo sharing application that demonstrates the following features of Azure App Service:\n\nApp Service authentication/authorization\nContinuous Integration and deployment\nMobile app server SDK\nMobile offline sync client SDK\nMobile file sync SDK\nMobile push notifications\n\n\n\nSample application\nI have created a small sample application. The source code is available here. It is simple carousel application that shows information about morning exercises.\nReferences:\nThere are a list of references and interesting information about Xamarin. Thank you for reading.
